# Interview

This repository is meant for prospective SCALARA frontend developers. It provides a very basic setup of the application.

In order to get started with the challenge, please fork this repository to your private GitHub.

We expect you to complete the following tasks:

* add functionality to add comments to a single post
* write tests in [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) or [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
* implement our provided [design](https://scalara.invisionapp.com/spec/ckusi9iaw02m00144f2050lge/select) using [material-ui](https://mui.com/)
* as a result, you should end up with two pages, one for /posts and one for /comments

Please do not spend more than 3 hours working on this task. Whatever is missing can still be discussed during the pair programming interview.

You may choose how you'd like to structure the modules within the `webApp/src/modules` directory. We normally structure them as following:
  * `/components`
  * `/containers`
  * `/hooks`

# Getting started

Use ```docker-compose up -d``` to run the backend web-server and the database, then follow the instructions in `web-app/README.md` to run the frontend web-app.
